The goal of MullerPlot is to generate Muller diagrams. Muller diagrams are plots which show the succession of different OTUs and their relative abundance/population dynamics over time. They are powerful and fascinating tools to visualize evolutionary processes, diversity and their dynamics, i.e. how diversity emerges and how changes over time. They are called Muller plots in honor of Hermann Joseph Muller which used them to explain his idea of Muller's ratchet. For more information please see the vignette.
